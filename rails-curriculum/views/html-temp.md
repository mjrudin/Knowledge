# HTML

Hypertext Markup Language is the language of web pages. **Go through
[the beginner tutorial on HTML Dog][html-dog-tutorial]** and then
check out some of the Mozilla reference documentation on HTML tags to
familiarize yourself with good documentation and the list of the tags
available to you.

You'll often hear HTML going along with CSS (cascading style sheets),
and while the two do often appear together, HTML is independent.  HTML
specifies structure and content. CSS specifies styling. We won't worry
about CSS for a little while.

The best, most complete HTML documentation is provided by the
[Mozilla Developer Network][mdn-html]. This documentation is your
friend. HTML Dog also has [a simple HTML reference][html-dog-docs]
that may be better for when you're just starting out.
