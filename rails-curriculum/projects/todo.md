# TodoApp

## Phase I: Project/Item

* A `Project` has many `Item`s todo.
* Write a form for `Project` and for `Item`s.
    * A `Project` should have a title and a text description of its purpose.
    * An `Item` should have a title, description, whether it was completed.
    * Select the `Project` from a select tag when you create a new item.
* The `Project` show page should list the `Item`s.
    * You don't know how to check the items as completed/uncompleted yet from
      the `Project` show page yet. Let the user click through to the
      `ItemsController#edit` page to do that. It's clunky, but stay the
      course.
* The `Item` show page should contain the `details` of the `Item`.
* Add links from the `Item` back to the `Project`.

## Phase II: Team/Project

* Each `Project` belongs to one `Team`.
* The `Team` show page should list the several `Project`s.
* Select the `Team` from a select tag.
* Add links from the `Project` back to the `Team`.

## Phase III: User

* A `User` may belong to many `Team`s; a `Team` will have many `User`s.
* You'll need a `TeamMembership` model.
* Use check boxes to associate `User` and `Team`.
* Your `User` show page should list the `Team`s the `User` is a member of.
* The `Team` show page should list the members.

## Phase IV: Nested routes

### Phase IVa: Nested `new` route

Suppose we want to add a new `Project` for a `Team`. We could go to the
`Project` form page, select the `Team` from the drop down, and then fill out
the form. However, if we're already on the `Team`'s show page, we would like
to simply click a link that will take us to the `Project` form, pre-selecting
the `Team` in the form.

One way to do this is to add a nested route:

```ruby
resources :teams do
  resources :projects, :only => [:new]
end
```

Requests to `teams/123/projects/new` will hit `ProjectsController#new`, but
with `params[:team_id]` set to `123`. Use this to create a `Project` with the
`team_id` attribute already set.

Your old `/projects/new` route should also still work (both routes will hit
the same controller action); it just won't do any default `Team` selection,
of course.

### Phase IVb: Nested `index` routes

Your `Project` show page lists all the `Item`s. This is fine, but if your
`Project` were to accumulate more data (maybe it has a long description, an
image, administrators, watchers, etc), you may not want to list all the
`Item`s on the show page.

To anticipate having more functionality in `Project`, we want to learn how to
break the associated `Item`s out to their own page:
`projects/:project_id/items`. This page can list the items in detail.

Nest an items resource within your projects resource. You only need the index
route. The `ItemsController#index` action should pull out the `project_id`
and only list the `Item`s for this `Project`.

The top-level items resource doesn't need an `index` method; it probably
doesn't make sense to list all the items for all the projects.

### Discussion: nested routes

It is typical to restrict nested routes to only `new` and `index` options.
The instance routes (the instance routes: `show`, `edit`, `update`, `delete`
are best accessed through the top-level resource). That's because it's more
convenient to `GET /items/123` than `GET /projects/456/items/123`; the
project id is redundant anyway if you have the item id.

As we've seen, `new` and `index` can be valuable nested routes; these are
collection methods, they don't include an item id.

You won't often need the `create` action (the last collection method) in your
nested resource. `POST /projects/456/items` is likely to be redundant, since
the project id will typically be embedded in the items parameters posted.

Finally, note that if you must create an item for a project, you may remove
the `new` and `index` resources. **Remove them from the top level items
resource**.

## Intermezzo

For each form you've written, write the HTML yourself without the Rails
helpers. You need to have equal facility with HTML and Rails forms helpers.

When you get to `select`ing `project.team` (and `item.project`), iterate
through `Team.all.each ...` (and `Project.all.each ...`), programmatically
generating the different options. Don't use the Rails helpers, but you can
still use ERB.

## Phase V: Checking projects as done in-line

Improve your `Project` show page so that you can check the items as
completed/uncompleted.

### Many ordinary forms

* Your `Project` show page iterates through the items, displaying a link to
  each one.
* For each link, show an `Item` form next to it. This form needs only to have
  a checkbox (completed or not) plus a submit button.

### One special form

This was a little annoying because we have a submit button for each `Item`.
We want checkboxes for each, but a single update button.

* Add an HTML `form` tag to your `Project` show page. Don't use `form_for`.
  This will be a special form, not a simple form for a single model object.
* Inside the `form`, iterate through the items one by one.
    * Display a link to the item show page.
    * Also, add a raw check box (`check_box_tag`); this will let the user
      toggle whether the item is completed.
    * Choose input names like `items[123][completed]` for `Item` #123.
    * Value should be "true".
    * Set the default value based on whether the item has already been
      completed.
* Add a submit button at the end
* Add a controller action, `ItemsController#batch_update`.
    * Iterate through the uploaded items, set the completed value as
      necessary.
* So far, **we can only set items as completed**; we can't uncomplete items.
    * The problem is that if a check box tag isn't selected, it doesn't get
      uploaded
    * To make sure that "false" will be uploaded if the checkbox isn't
      checked, add a hidden field, `items[123][completed]`, with value
      "false". Add this the line before the check box.
    * If the checkbox is checked, its value will "override" the hidden field;
      if not at least the hidden field's "false" value will be uploaded.
    * Note that this is kind of like the "bumper" checkbox.
