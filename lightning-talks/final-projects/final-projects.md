# Final Projects and Interview Day

At the end of the cycle we will begin building independent projects
which will showcase the skills you've learned throughout the class.

We will continue to have lightning-talk style lectures, but we will
not assign additional projects; the last two weeks are entirely to
build self-directed projects. We will continue to circulate to help
you build your projects.

Our goal is for you to build two projects, each taking about one
week. We will demo your first project internally at the end of week
eight. At the end of week nine, we hold interview day.

## Submitting project ideas

* What features will it have?
* What, generally speaking, will be the structure of the data model?
    * What are the model objects?
    * What are the associations?
* What will features of Rails/JS will it touch on?
    * See especially the list below.
* How will you decompose the project into steps? In what order will
  you add features?

Lastly, final projects do not need to be done TDD, but they should
feature enough tests to show that you know how to write them. In
particular, if you struggle to implement a feature correctly, make
sure to test that feature closely. Otherwise you'll make some commit
that breaks it and you'll have to debug it all over again. **You
should test more than you'll instinctively want to**.

Lastly, make sure to use git throughout. Setup git on your machine
properly so that your commits are properly attributed to you. **If you
haven't been using git carefully up to now, here is your chance.**
Commit early and **often**; you'll have lots of bugs, and if you
introduce regressions you want to be able to rollback to a time when
things worked right.

## Interview day

Interview day consists of speed-dating style interviews (~7-8min) with
recruiting companies. You talk with the employers about your
background, what they do, and show them things you have built. You
follow-up with them afterward to schedule additional interviews.

## Schedule

* w7d4: submit plan for your project #1 for approval
* w8d1: begin project #1
* w8d4: submit plan for your project #2 for approval
* w8d5: internal demo day; show independent project #1 to the class
* w9d1: begin project #2
* w9d5: interview day!

## Project checklist

Your projects should emphasize the technologies you've
learned. Remember, the projects are much more a showcase of your
technical ability than the creativity of your idea.

* Basic CRUD
* Complex forms (nested, setup has-many associations, etc)
* Devise
* Bootstrap
* ActionMailer
    * Sendgrid
* Tests
* Make sure to organize with partials, helpers
* More complex query logic
* Nested routing
* jQuery
* AJAX
* APIs (consumption and construction)

### Bonus tech

* Heroku scheduler
* Delayed job
* Kaminari
* Paperclip
* state_machine

## Other advice

* Should be able to progress from a CRUD Rails app and then build on
  additional features.
* Have a backup plan; should be able to work as a CRUD Rails app.
* Don't use tech I don't know
