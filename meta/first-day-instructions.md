# First day instructions

A few instructions as you start out.

* Read the [pair programming chapter][pair-programming] before
  starting.
* Use Textmate, already installed. **No exceptions**. We all use the
  same text editor, even if you have experience with something
  else. We need both members of the pair to be comfortable switching
  editors.
    * Don't use technologies that your partner doesn't know; you'll
      make them helpless. This really **makes me angry** if you do
      this, so please do not.
* **Turn off** cell phone. This is really distracting and is not
  allowed.
* Each day create your own directory for code (call the first one
  `w1d1`).
* Read how to [look problems up](./looking-things-up.md)
* [Lunch spots][lunch].
