pair effectively.

## Assessments

* Assessments are intended to give you early feedback so you know
  whether you are keeping up.
* Assessments are given the first several Mondays, in class. They take
  about an hour.
* Assessments are done solo.
* Assessment material contains no surprises; master the "Goals"
  sections of each reading and you'll be in good shape.
* Students who fail two assessments may be asked to leave the program.

## General advice

* Push yourself hard
  * Previous courses were very successful; most
    everyone got a job, but keep in mind,
    the average workweek was ~80hrs.
  * We schedule a break in addition to lunch so that people stay
    loose.
  * Don't take unscheduled breaks without asking.
  * Return on-time from breaks: lateness penalties apply.
* Focus on understanding deeply, not on finishing quickly
  * The course is fast-paced, but the way to keep up is not to rush
    things. Instead, it is to learn things as they are presented.
  * The only way to learn things as they are presented is to always
    be deeply engaging with the material. Push your understanding.
  * Ask tons of questions and read carefully. Do not be satisfied
    until you have built a good mental model of the concepts we
    cover.
  * The only way to test your understanding is to code and to explain
    things. Always try to explain what you think is happening; that
    way, the people around you can correct your mental model if it is
    in error.
* Greatest risk is that you fall behind and don't receive help
  promptly.
  * The course moves quickly and builds on previous material; you
    can't afford to fall behind.
  * If you start to fall behind, you need to take action quickly.
  * The best way to catch up is to find people to spend extra time
    working with. We'll try to help, but you need to be proactive
    in reaching out to instructors and fellow students.
  * If you fall behind, you need to spend extra time studying
    until you catch up.
* You need to ask questions.
  * If an instructor writes a line of code you don't understand, you
    *have* to ask what it means.
  * If an instructor explains something but it doesn't make sense, you
    *have* to say so.
  * We'll try to make sure you understand what we teach, but we need
    your help, too.
  * When you're pairing and your partner writes some code you don't
    understand, ask about it. If they can't explain it, get an
    instructor to explain it. And if you're the person writing some
    code your partner doesn't understand, explain it!
* Start work early!
  * It's hard to estimate how long something may take; everyone works
    at a different pace.
  * Make sure you start early, so that you don't get stuck behind
    schedule.
