# Daily requirements

## tl;dr

* Read next day's readings. Review, but don't do, the exercises
  (they're for in class the next day).
* Write your daily reflection.
* Send your daily progress email.

## Readings and Q&A

* Instead of formal lectures, we have readings to be completed after
  class.
* We will occasionally have code demos.
* At the beginning of each day, we will have a Q&A session. Come
  prepared with questions.

## Daily reflection

* Write a daily learning reflection each day.
* Create a Tumblr to log your reflections.
* You should detail what you've learned that day.
* Daily reflections are a very important component of the class.
  * Summarizing what you have learned will help solidify your
    knowledge of the material.
  * It gives us feedback which will make the course better for you and
    other students.
  * Your reflection will also help in the hiring process: you will
    have a detailed record of what you have learned and how quickly
    you have learned it to show employers.
* Fine for not completing and emailing a link to the daily reflection is $10/day.

**Tip**: In your Tumblr preferences set "Edit posts using:" to Markdown.
It's the same syntax as Github's md, and will help you get better at
formatting your READMEs and documentation.

## Daily progress email

Write your team leader a daily progress email, due before 9:00AM the following day. 
The fine for not sending the daily email is $10/day. Use the appropriate template below.
