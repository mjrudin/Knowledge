# Getting a Job

## Meta

The end may be far away but there are some things that you should be doing NOW to improve your job prospects after the course ends.  You may think that it's easy to get hired or you may be terrified of what comes next.  Ideally, you're feeling a combination of both.

The fact is that Rails developers are in demand but it's equally true that no one is handing out jobs.  If you bust your ass for the whole 9 weeks of the program, you WILL graduate with the skills necessary to be a junior developer.  That said, you will also need to **hustle** to get that job.

## What to expect 

You'll be working hard for the next 9 weeks.  You'll learn Ruby, Rails, Javascript and a host of supporting skills.  Later in the program, we'll teach you skills and fundamentals that will help you interview and what to do with an offer.  You'll have hands-on practice sessions and we'll provide a wealth of resources that you can leverage going forward. 

At the end of the program, you will present your capstone projects at a demo day and meet some of our hiring partners.  For the most part, this will be a good experience but it isn't the end of the road.  

It typically takes 1-2 months to get hired.  The most important skill during that time period is perserverance because you'll end up applying to many dozens of places and getting turned down plenty of times before you find the right fit.  

You'll have days where several people schedule phone interviews or you complete a couple coding tests and you'll feel pretty good.  Then you'll have days where you don't hear anything back or have an inbox full of declines and it'll feel pretty crummy.  Your first offer may be the most nerve-racking part of all.  Luckily, we're all in it together.  We can help answer any questions you have during the process and your fellow students will help you tweak your portfolios, prepare for the interviews and smooth out the emotional rollercoaster a bit.

Those are more or less the facts of the process, but there are things you should be doing in the meantime to help yourself out.


## What to do

The hiring period doesn't start at week 9... it's already begun.  Learning everything you can about the curriculum.  In the time you have left over (ha!), there are some other things you should do to help yourself out later:

* Get out and meet developers!  Meetups like hack nights are some of the best ways to do this since they're really casual and everyone has something in common.  TALK to people:  

  * Find out what a developer actually does.  You will learn to code but it's also important to develop a more general sense of what you'll be expected to do on the job and some of the vocabulary of the developer community.

  * Figure out what different types of companies do and how that impacts your life as a developer working for them.  This isn't just important for deciding where to work... if you come into an interview clueless about the type of role you've applied for, odds are not in your favor.

  * Seek out peers and mentors who are willing to answer questions or even help you on projects.  Devs are generally nice people who like to help out (again, particularly at hack nights and the like) if you ask nicely and seem like a humble sort of person.

  * Knowing developers is a MUCH easier way to get hired at a place than spamming their hiring page.  Tech is a business of people too.  Recommendations carry a lot of weight and it's much better to come into the process as a known quantity to a developer who only cares how good you are than as just another resume glanced at by an HR person trained to care about CS degrees and work experience.  Odds are slim that you'll meet someone who will land you that dream job and that's not really the right way to approach things, but keep it in the back of your mind.  
  
* A bit later in the course, GO TO JOB FAIRS (we'll let you know when we can but send them out to the mailing list if you find any we have missed).  They are a free way to get exposure to potentially dozens of companies you never otherwise would.  Even if you haven't yet built a ton of stuff, sometimes just asking intelligent and insightful questions can get you on people's radar.  Send thank you emails afterwards if you've made a decent connection and don't be afraid to follow up later on when you do have an application built to show off.  As they say, it's better to be a growth curve than just a point.

* Present yourself in the best possible light:
  * Keep your github repos clean and logical; they are your developer's resume as much as your collection of deployed apps.  Have a simple README file explaining each project (don't use the default one that Rails provides) and try to code with the understanding that other people may look at it.  This is particularly relevant during the larger projects later in the course.
  * Get a LinkedIn profile and keep it classy.  It's often the first place people will look when your name comes across their desk.
  * Start dusting off the old traditional resume for good measure.
  * Take down that stupid picture of yourself doing a beer bong on Facebook.  Actually, you are hereby banned from posting, tweeting, tumbling, or otherwise making known to the world anything related to your copious drinking, drug use or extremist views.
  * Write your blogs as though an employer was reading.
  
* Check out job postings
  * Go to the main job boards (Monster, Indeed , 37signals, WhiteTruffle, Hacker News "Who's Hiring", Developer Auction, Coder Wall... see resources below) and just see what kind of positions people are looking for and what kind of language they use to describe them.  This isn't about finding yourself a job, it's about developing a job-search vocabulary and a sense of context.
  * Write down the companies that seem to be hiring or are particularly interesting to you.  If you add a little bit to that list every day and keep your ear to the ground, it's a lot easier than cramming at the last minute to find places to apply to.  
  
* **BE A HUSTLER!**  The more places you know about, people who know you, applications you submit, practice interviews you do etc. the better your odds of getting hired.  Nothing is an excuse for being a terrible coder (so... pay attention) but you can help yourself out by better understanding the world you are seeking to be a part of.


## So Many Choices...

"Developer" is a pretty generic term and, fortunately, it's also a highly transferrable skill.  This is by no means a comprehensive listing but there are a few general types of companies out there that hire developers:

### Consultancies

* Consulting shops get hired by everyone from startups to enterprise companies to build their websites.  Sometimes you're working on a hot app with an understaffed consumer internet startup and 3 months later it'll be a fully in-house ground-up web application for something completely different.

* They make their money by hiring you out at a substantial hourly rate.  Projects can last anywhere from a few weeks to many months.  Companies are often flexible about rotating people around if projects take a long time.

* It's hourly billing so it's generally more of a 9-5 type lifestyle (but you'll be learning so much at first that I wouldn't bet on it)

* Some shops do internships as a lead-in / trial period before taking on jr devs

* A Few Examples:
  * ThoughtBot
  * CarbonFive
  * Pivotal Labs

### Product Companies

* This kind of covers everything else... You'd be working as part of a larger team on a web application.  You will often be working in a larger code base.
* They were once startups...
* The difficulty of getting hired by these companies varies considerably... places like Facebook, Google, or Twitter are known for being extremely difficult to get into.
* A Few Examples:
  * Facebook
  * Twitter
  * Eventbrite
  * New Relic
  * Square
  * Dropbox
  * Google
  * Salesforce

### Startups

* Obviously this is a pretty broad category.  Lots of companies call themselves startups because it's cool but most of them are really just... companies.  If you're really just scaling your business model, you aren't technically a startup, so here I'm referring to the smallest players out there.

* Startups are often underfunded and overworked so you would expect to work incredibly hard without a lot of guidance.  It can be tough to work as a jr dev for a startup because they're typically in the market for someone who can produce on day one. 

* Read Hacker News for the latest examples...
