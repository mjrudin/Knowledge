# SQL Curriculum TODO

## SQL

* Better SQL introduction
* SQL homework exercises along with introduction (before SQL zoo)
* Replace SQL book readings (too long/dense)

* Reading: different database implementations
* Reading: database servers
* Reading: databases under the hood (EXPLAIN PLAN)
* Reading: indexing

## ActiveRecord

* Better intro
* Associations
  * Better intro (students would build associations and then not
    use them); purpose of associations
  * class_name, foreign_key, primary_key introduced up front
  * Required to specify defaults and overrides on every association
  * AR querying methods & chaining
