# Closures and scope

## Scope

The **scope** of a method is the set of variables that are available
for use within the method. Scope in JS is nested:

```javascript
function sum(nums) {
  var count = 0;
  
  function addNum(num) {
    // `count` here refers to the outside defined count variable.
    // We can access it in here, because at the point where `addNum`
    // is defined, `count` was "in scope".
    count += num;
  }
  
  // run the addNum function for each num
  nums.forEach(addNum);
  
  return count;
}
```

The variables available when we call a function include:

0. the arguments
0. any local variables declared inside the function
0. **any variables that were declared when the function was first
   defined**.

Scopes are nested. A new, inner scope is created each time a function
is called. The function can refer to this new, current scope, or
anything from the enclosing scope.

Not only can we access the outside variables, we can even reset
them. This is what lets the `addNum` method modify the outside `count`
variable.

In JavaScript, every function has access to the variables from
enclosing scopes. Functions that use (or *capture*) these variables
(called *free variables*) are called *closures*. `addNum`, which
captures `count`, is a closure.

## Examples

Lots of helper code (for instance, `_.times`) will take a function and
call it later. A typical limitation is that the passed function must
not take any arguments. To get around this problem, we introduce an
anonymous closure which takes no arguments, but references key
variables from outside its definition.

```javascript
function greetTenTimes(name) {
  _.times(10, function () {
    // captures `name` from outside.
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
  });
}
```

In JavaScript, this kind of thing happens **all the time**. This is a
very, very common JS technique, so become familiar with it :-)

### Private state

Another major use of closures is to create some private state. For
example:

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  var count = 1;

  return function () {
    return count++;
  };
}

counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // => 1
console.log(counter()); // => 2
```

By *closing over* (or *capturing*) the `count` variable, the returned
function is a little more like an object than a traditional
function. Calling it repeatedly with the same (no) arguments gives
different results, because it references private, mutable state (the
`count` varaiable).

The returned counter closure is sort-of like an object, in that it has
its own state. That's a cool technique, and it's a good fit for
something simple like this.

However, a more straightforward and less idiosyncratic solution using
a class is probably the better solution:

```javascript
function Counter() {
  this._count = 0;
}

Counter.prototype.fire = function () {
  this._count += 1;
  return this._count;
};
```

One advantage of the closure way is that the count is **truly
private**. In our example, a foolish user might set `this._count`
inadvertently.

True privacy is overrated. As you recall, nothing is truly private in
Ruby; we can always call `send` to defeat privacy protections. A good
compromise in JavaScript is to name "private" attributes with a
leading underscore: `_count` should indicate to the user that he or
she ought not mess with this variable.
