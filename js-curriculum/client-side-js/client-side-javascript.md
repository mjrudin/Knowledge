# Client-side JavaScript

We've seen how to use node.js to run our code server-side as a script
or in a REPL. Now it's time to learn how to run our code in the
browser.

We should remember: the browser is a different *environment* from
node.js. Some things from node.js won't work in the browser
(especially `require`), while some things we can only do in the
browser (manipulate the HTML page, prompt the user for input).

## Loading JavaScript in a web page

```html
<html>
<head>
  <title>A page for you!</title>
</head>

<body>
  <div id="content">
  </div>

  <!-- first load the jQuery library hosted by Google -->
  <script type="application/javascript"
           src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js">
  </script>
  <!-- then load our own app.js code -->
  <script type="application/javascript" src="./app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>                              
```

Whenever the browser encounters a `script` tag, it will make a request
for the javascript source and download it. It will then execute the
JavaScript code, and continue reading the HTML.

Here we first load jQuery, which is meant to make HTML manipulation,
event handling (mouse clicks, for instance), and AJAX requests
(background web requests) easy. We'll learn more about it later.

Then we load our own `app.js`. Here's what I cooked up:

```javascript
// dynamically inject creepy Andy Warhol photo
$("#content").append('<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Andy_Warhol_by_Jack_Mitchell.jpg">');

function addElvis () {
  // a little too much Elvis
  $("#content").append('<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Eight_Elvises.jpg">');
}

// repeatedly call addElvis once every second.
window.setInterval(addElvis, 1000);
```

Paste the code into your own `example.html` and `app.js` files and try
it out in your browser!
