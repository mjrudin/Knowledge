# Todo list
Estimated time: 6hrs.

Write a Todo list application. It

* Should support multiple `Users`
* Should support multiple `Lists` per `User`
* Should support multiple `Tasks` per `List`
* Should support `Tag`ging of `Tasks`
  * Should be able to search a `User`'s `Task`s by `Tag`
* Should support priority for `Tasks`
* Should save and load serialized data

Your program should take the username as a command line argument. It
should then present a user interface where the user can create new
lists and tasks, tag tasks, view a list, and view all his list items
that have been tagged.

All the program data should be serialized to files.
