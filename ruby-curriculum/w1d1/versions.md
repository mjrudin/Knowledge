# A note on Ruby versions

Different versions of Ruby have subtly (or sometimes not-so-subtly)
different APIs. You can probably save yourself some time and
frustration by referring only to the documentation for the version
you're using.

You can verify your version in a shell with `ruby -v`.

The default version for this course is currently [Ruby
1.9.3](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/).
