# Mastermind

Estimated time: 1hr.

In this project, you'll implement the game [Mastermind][wiki-mastermind].

* There are six different peg colors:
  * Red
  * Green
  * Blue
  * Yellow
  * Orange
  * Purple
* The computer will select a random code of four pegs.
* The user gets ten turns to guess the code.
  * You decide how the user inputs his guess.
  * Maybe like so "RGBY" for red-green-blue-yellow
* The computer should tell the player how many exact matches (right
  color in right spot) and near matches (right color, wrong spot) he or she
  has.
* Game ends when user guesses the code, or out of turns.
