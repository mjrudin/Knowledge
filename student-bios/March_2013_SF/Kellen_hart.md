###Bio

I've spent my life orbiting computers, using them, but not realizing how much joy I could gain from diving in and building programs with them.  After spending the last five years on various projects, from working at a health clinic for the underserved, to rebuilding a house from almost falling apart, to studying aerial acrobatics, I realized that I needed something that I could feel great about in the long run.

I started a year and a half ago studying web development on my own.  My pace wasn't satisfactory, so I joined App Academy and have learned about full stack web development faster than I ever thought possible.

I am excited to work for a company that takes on interesting projects, has a communicative, healthy environment, and wants their employees always improving.  I will focus my near term work and learning on Rails and Javascript, and hope to continue my improvement towards true expertise.
