###Bio

Hi. I studied math and physics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, enjoyed the problem-solving nature of those fields, and have become inspired by the potential of programming to bring about amazing things that benefit so many people so quickly. After learning on my own for a year and a half through Coursera and independent projects, I decided to accelerate my learning in an intensive environment with others similarly motivated.

Over the past several weeks at App Academy, I have learned a lot about myself and coding, and am now looking to continue growing as a software engineer and as a person while contributing to a team.
