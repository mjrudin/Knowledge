#####Hi!

I discovered programming during an avionics internship at SpaceX, 
it was love at first sight. Our relationship grew while I pursued 
my physics thesis research at Reed College in Portland. After 
graduation, I got a job in QA and UX for an enterprise software 
company in LA.Immediately, I realized that I _needed_ to be the one
building and creating things, not just trying to break them so I 
packed up and left LA for the Bay Area. After a few weeks of 
teaching myself the Django framework in coffee-shops during the day 
and crashing on friends couches at night, I discovered App Academy 
and knew what I had to do.

I'm passionate about well written software, thoughtfully crafted goods,
classical mechanics, bicycles, and the future.

My capstone project, [chore-app](https://github.com/dylanclark112/roommates),
is a way to manage household choresand send passive-aggressive 
reminders to your fellow adult roommates (the plight of our generation). 
My focus was on making a simple, zippy, single-page Backbone app. I 
used delayed-job, twilio (for reminders), devise, backbone, 
backbone-relational, backbone-forms, and a sprinkle of jQuery UI for
drag 'n drop. [Check it out](choreapp.herokuapp.com).
