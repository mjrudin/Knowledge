#Peter Lin

###Bio

Hey there. I'm Peter, and I'm a software engineer from Australia. I studied finance as an undergrad, and I worked as a derivatives trader at Tibra Capital after graduation. I developed a strong interest in trading systems, and decided that I really wanted to work as a software engineer. 

Tibra suggested I do some studies in software engineering, so I looked around and found the ALM in IT program at Harvard University Extension School, which I thought was an excellent program. Only problem was, it was for people who already program. Spent the next 4 months before the program began learning everything I can by taking courses on iTunesU, including Stanford's CS106A, CS106B, and CS107, and Harvard's CS50. It all went well, and after 2 years, I completed the program and graduated as top graduate in class.

Decided to move to SF and do App Academy because I've always wanted to move to the US, and I wanted to learn more about web development. This has been a great experience, and I'm sure all of us have learned heaps of Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript.
