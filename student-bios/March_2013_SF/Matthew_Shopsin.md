###Bio

I have been writing software professionally since I was 16 when I started writing data visualization code for NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies, which is a joint institute with Columbia University.  In that capacity I wrote tools for displaying atmospheric data and setting up climate models in Java, PHP, mysql, and several esoteric DBs.  During college I worked at an IBM facility that was working on the processor in the XBox360, in that capacity I created a private cloud based solution in Java that helped identify manufacturing defects, that was in use for at least five years.  After College I joined Intel and took part in their rotation engineering program that allowed me to rotate through several different groups and finally land in intel's storage technology group.  In that group I worked on a wide range of projects from block level drivers to a network file system.

When the recession hit I decided to head for graduate school, where I had the opportunity to fill in some gaps in my knowledge regarding theory and work with a professor on a quantum computing project.

Since graduate school I spent a year working for 10gen/mongoDB on a iOS App that would monitor mongod instances.  Also, while at mongo I had the opportunity to teach classes, give a talk on geospatial awareness in San Diego, and write several patches to the Perl driver.

Since leaving mongo I have done some iOS consulting work as well as releasing several apps to the store, but have wanted to move into full stack web development.  App Academy has provided me with the necessary tools to make the shift.

Going forward I look forward to tackling exciting full stack challenges.

###Capstone Project

PDFtagger
 is a collaborative pdf annotation tool.  It allows for many users to post documents and select regions of the document that they want to tag.  Other users can in turn respond to the tags.  Potential uses for a service like this could be: having parts of a document translated by a person, transcription of scanned receipts, and identification of regions of a photograph.

The App allows for sign with Facebook using devise and the rest of the app is a single page app implemented with a combination of backbone, jquery, javascript, and ajax.
