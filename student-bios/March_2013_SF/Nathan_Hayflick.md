#Nathan Hayflick

###Bio

Iâ€™m Nate -- I graduated from Stanford in 2010 with a B.A. in Russian Literature and I first decided that I wanted to learn how to program while I was doing marketing and content development for an educational software startup. I was originally attracted to web development because I wanted to tackle challenging and creative problems and build things that I could share with the world. Besides programming, I like to geek out about music technology/production, travel, UX and the sharing economy. Here are some things that are important than me:

  - Well-crafted and maintainable code
  - Object-oriented programming
  - Embracing new technologies
  - Zenlike user experiences
  - Eye-catching design
  - Well-integrated usage of external APIs
  - Open source software projects
  - TDD/BDD
  - Deploying code as frequently as possible


###Capstone project

  PhotoJar: A web application for creating, customizing and sharing stylized mosaics of your photo collection. Each 'jar' contains two to four images arranged in a combination of 3x4 and panoramic formats. The goal of the app was to allow users to easily tie together groups of photos by theme, style or narrative and then share them in a simple, fast and visually-engaging environment. The app also allows users to tag photos and follow other users. With the exception of the signup/login page, PhotoJar is a single-page app that relies on a Backbone.js framework to sync photos, jars and users with a RESTful backend built entirely on Rails. It also relies heavily on custom jQuery to allow users to create and manipulate their jars.
