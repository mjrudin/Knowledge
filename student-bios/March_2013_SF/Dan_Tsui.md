###Bio

After graduating from UC Berkeley and working as an architect for 6 ½ years I realized I love creating and building things, but I caught the coding bug about 2 years ago when I began creating plugins for my architectural drafting software and virtual walkthroughs of my buildings with the Unity Game engine. It was enough to inspire me to leave my career as an architect last year and embark on my path to becoming a software developer. Starting with C# and Python and eventually finding my way to App Academy, I’m ready to take the next step in realizing a career as software developer!

 

###Capstone Project

Cycling App:

Combining my background as a triathlete and my passion for coding, my capstone project is rebuilding one of my favorite web apps, Strava. My cycling app can upload and parse GPX data files and visualize the data in real-time with the help of D3, Leaflet Maps, and Google Street View. Inspired by one of my favorite cycling app, Strava, my cycling app strives to recreate the same responsive UX by optimizing my data structure and caching data models on the client side. Upload your own GPX data and try it out!
