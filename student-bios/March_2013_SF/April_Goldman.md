###Bio

I’m a writer, coder, and climber who (now) builds cool RoR/JS apps.  I studied Computer Science at Rice, earned an MFA in creative writing from the University of Houston, and then worked as an Analyst at Google for four years. I left Google to learn web development languages and frameworks, and I ended up at App Academy thanks to a mix of luck and chance. Most recently, I’ve built the web app Four Legs Good to connect local dog owners for free pet sitting.
 
I’m looking for a job where I can learn new things every day and work on innovative products with smart people. I’m interested in both front and backend development and will continue full-stack projects in my free time.
