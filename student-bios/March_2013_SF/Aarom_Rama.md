Bio:

Ever since broadband arrived in New Zealand several years ago, I’ve been fascinated by the internet. This fascination led to me to start building websites at the age of 13 ( currently 19 years old ). I’ve been heavily involved with building and running websites ever since. However up until App Academy I would use pre built software rather than being able to code my own.

The drive to be able to make my own applications and to be able to do something big is what spurred me to leave my life in New Zealand behind, to come to San Francisco and train to become a web developer. I had just finished my first year of university, in which I was doing a bachelor of commerce, majoring in Information Systems and E-Commerce. However university was too slow pace for me and there wasn’t enough practicality and so App Academy was the perfect environment for me to learn in.

I’ve thoroughly enjoyed learning Rails and love working with it, however I can’t wait to start looking into more web technologies to expand my skillset and improve the quality of what I can build.

Capstone:

For my capstone project I decided to clone Facebook and make my own version called “MyFace”. I’ve always been fascinated by social networking and its effects on society and thus this has been a vastly enjoyable project.

MyFace is built on Rails with Javascript/jQuery sprinkled in to enhance the UI. I chose to primarily focus on Rails in order to dive deeper into the cool things that it can do, such as polymorphic associations. I experimented with a different type of database design, that mimicked Reddit’s which allowed me to have more flexible User’s. I also wrote a lot of the code myself rather then relying on gems in order to make sure I understood what was going on.
