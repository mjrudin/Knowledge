###Bio

I arrived at App Academy after falling in love with programming while living in Berlin. Like San Francisco, Berlin has a vibrant tech scene. I regularly attended tech Meetups as well as workshops and events at the Open Tech School. By attending these events, I was able to pick up HTML, CSS, Javascript, Processing, Ruby and Git. Simultaneously, I was making a lot of progress in online programming courses like Codeacademy and  Code School. After getting my feet wet, it was clear that I wanted become a full-time programmer, which lead me to apply to App Academy.  

App Academy has taught me basic algorithms, data-structures, principles of object-oriented design, relational databases and web-technologies. We have not only learned how to use Rails, but have actually rebuilt our own versions of Active Record and Action Controller in order to grasp the underlying principles and design patterns.

Since I have been at App Academy, my skills have been improving rapidly. In just nine weeks, I have been introduced to so many new skills and concepts, and I aim to continue pushing myself to learn new technologies and concepts while continuing to master my craft. My ideal post-App Academy position would be as a full-stack web developer.

I connect with people about the things I love

I write about the technologies I’m learning and regularly attend tech Meetups. It’s always been important for me to connect with and learn from others in the field and, in turn, I hope to inspire and impart some knowledge on people who are just starting out. (Please feel free to look at my personal development blog)

I work hard and aim for the best

Whatever I am up to, I give it my all. I am ready and willing to work hard to learn new skill sets and new techniques. I rarely feel that something is perfect; there is always room for improvement, and I enjoy trying to make the project as great as it can be.

###Capstone Project

exquisite.gif : an app that enables users to build animated GIFs. GIFs are drawn frame by frame using HTML5 canvas. Multiple users can draw frames of the animation before frames are finally compressed into a single animation. In the background, frames are stored in the database as Base64 encoded strings. When the user decides to build the animated GIF, all the frames of the animation are converted into image files and then compressed into a gif (using Heroku’s temporary file system); The animated GIF is then sent to S3 and saved in the cloud. Since this process is relatively time intensive, GIFs are managed by a background worker using delayed job.
