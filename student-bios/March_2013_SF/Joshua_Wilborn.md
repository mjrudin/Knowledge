###Bio

When I was a young teenager in the 90's, I first developed my interest in coding.  I started off by dabbling in web design.   At the time, there was a popular internet game called Dark Forces: Jedi Knight 2.  I was a cowebmaster on this site at the age of 13.  This stimulated further curiosity which I satisfied by learning scripting for MIRC.  

I got involved in IRC because it was a great place to ask questions about coding html and javascript.  In my travels through the chat rooms I came across a very interesting place.  This room was dedicated to "kick bots".  Each user in the room was a bot that would attempt to take control of the room and kickban all other users while maintaining admin status.  This king of the hill competition really spurred me forward.  I did everything I could to streamline my code to run faster and more efficiently so that my bot could respond fast enough to win.

After this I moved on to Cisco Networking in high school and A+ computer repair.  Unfortunately this meant my programming interests went on the backburner for the time being.  

Once I completed high school I spent 6 years in the US Army.  My job title was electronics technician.  I did component level repair and was qualified to work on over 300 pieces of equipment including nightvision gear and nuclear-biological-chemical agent detection equipment.

The last couple of years I've been trying to readapt to civilian life and decide what I want to do with my life.  Through this process I rekinkled and rediscovered my love of programming and computers.  Luckily I came across the app academy, which seemed the perfect vehicle to fulfill my dream.

I'd like to work with people who are passionate about learning.  A place where I would stagnate and not gain new skills or find challenges, would not be my ideal workplace.  


###Capstone Project

When I attended the University of Oklahoma I was a member of the Omega Delta Phi Fraternity.  I noticed that when I moved away, it became hard to keep in touch with brothers and find brothers in my new location.  Because of this I decided to write "Brocator".  

The Brocator is a simple app to connect fraternities and their brothers.  Users can search for specific brothers they know, events in an area, or simply view a map of all brothers near them and what fraternity they are in.  You can view it at brocator.herokuapp.com.

On this project I decided to focus on Rails and on my second project I plan to focus on JS Backbone.
