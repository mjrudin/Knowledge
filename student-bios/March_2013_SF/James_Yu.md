###Bio

I left college for two years to join GX Media, an online startup focused on video game media. I started as a freelance writer and worked up to become Editor-in-Chief of Firingsquad.com, their primary profit-generating publication. The site doesn't look like much now but it was on the same level as Anandtech and Tom's Hardware back then.

During that time I learned about how to develop stories that would generate traffic. It's pretty easy to figure out after you notice that an XYZ motherboard review only generates 500 uniques while an [Insert unreleased version of Windows here] Gaming Performance Preview generates 50,000 uniques. I decided to return to school to finish my degree after we burned through our funding ($14 million, CMGI lead).     

After graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in English Literature, I worked for a year as a marketing manager for an online PC hardware retailer where I quickly learned how not to waste a marketing budget. My role expanded into product management during that time because I figured out that I needed to work with our development team to improve site features to increase customer conversion rates and retention rates to get customer lifetime value (LTV) > cost per acquisition (CPA). 

Spending money on marketing to drive in leads doesn't make sense if your bucket can't hold on to any customers. I was able to implement several new site features that helped improve the customer experience and increase our store ratings while also reducing support costs (fewer customer complaints/inquiries).     

I left that position when a former GX Media colleauge talked me into joining GameSpot.com as Senior Hardware Editor. This was an incredibly fun job where I had the privilege to lead the hardware editorial coverage for the largest video game Website in the world. I was able to use my experience in story idea development and execution to make sure that my team consistently produced GameSpot's highest traffic-generating stories. 

My previous employer, the PC hardware retailer, eventually lured me back with a director-level role in marketing and product management and the opportunity to gain operational experience with P&L responsibilities. During my second tenure, I implemented new strategies, policies, and countless internal tools and Website improvements that increased revenues from $13 million a year to $34 million a year.    

I decided to join App Academy because itâ€™s my ultimate goal to do my own startup and I felt that I needed to learn how to build my own MVP (minimum viable product) to round out my professional skill set.
