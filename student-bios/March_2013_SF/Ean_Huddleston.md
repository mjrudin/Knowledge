###Bio

After eight years conducting academic research (on the topic of cognitive neuroscience), I decided that it was time to pursue a career in which my success was more directly tied to the effort I put in, and in which I could see a more immediate result from my labor.  
Before going into research, I obtained a B.S. in computer engineering.  While studying for my degree, I found the few computer science courses I took to be among my favorite classes.  In the course of conducting academic research, I had the opportunity to do more programming, writing a variety of audio-visual programs to be used in psychological experiments, and creating scripts in Matlab to analyze data.  These experiences gave me a taste of what a career in software development might entail, and whet my appetite for more.  
After deciding to make the jump into software development and to focus on web development, I took a couple online courses on the topic, and worked on some personal web app projects.  I then happened upon App Academy and decided that it was exactly what I needed to jump start my transition into a career as a web developer.  I have had a great experience in the course, and am now looking forward to continuing to hone my skills while working as a junior web developer on products that people love to use.

###Capstone Project

WhatsUp.com

WhatsUp.com github repo

A Rails application for posting and discovering events of a more local nature.  Users can submit new events, assigning them categories (live music, happy hour, garage sale, etc).  Users can then search for new events around their location based on distance and refine their search results based on event categories.  On each event page, users can make comments about the event and indicate if they are planning to attend (with a total count of people planning to attend displayed on the page).
