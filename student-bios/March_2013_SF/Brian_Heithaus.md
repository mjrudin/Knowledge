###Bio

Hi my name is Brian.
I love creating.  I love learning.  I really love creating while pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and skills in technology.
My first programming experience was with Pascal, in High School, and then OOP and Java.  I really loved the problem solving and building aspects of software development.

I went on to study Engineering and Entrepreneurship at University.  Some of my favorite courses were probably Materials Science, Calculus and Engineering Intro which involved creating a programmed robotic vehicle with a team.  I also loved African drumming course, as music runs in my blood.

Since college I have been busy trying to make the world a better place in my own way, and I'm always seeking.  I enjoy getting lost in the moment while working on building a coding project.

So, as I have always been working with different creative tools,  building websites, producing music, and building bicycles, I decided I would love to get back into the problem solving of Coding!  A few months ago after studying JS and Python on my own, I decided to dive in!  I heard about App Academy, started learning about Ruby and decided it was for me!
I have loved learning so much at a fairly quick pace.  Writing a full-stack web application has turned out to be very interesting and full of opportunities for problem solving.  I have also REALLY loved writing interactive front-end code with Javascript.



Now that the program is nearing completion I am so excited to start looking for the right team to join!
I am seeking a group where I can produce great code, contribute to and build projects that I am excited about, learn by doing, and work with cutting edge technologies.
