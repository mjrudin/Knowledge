###Bio
I've been interested in programming ever since my first hello world program in Java course back in high school. I soon found myself programming silly ascii games during lunchtime, but never took programming beyond a side hobby. Instead I studied plant biology in college, where I continued to periodically dabble in programming, including a bioinformatics course on Perl.

After graduating from college I started working as an analyst and later product manager of an electronic health record software company. I frequently worked with the India based dev team to resolve bugs and implement new features. I often found myself wishing I had a more direct influence over the direction the software took, both on the user experience level and the features being developed. This experience combined with my own interest in programming led me  to consider pursuing programming as a career; and that's where App Academy came in.

App Academy has been a great experience for me, providing me with an environment that's really jumpstarted my progress in programming. Although it's only been two months, I've made tremendous progress and I'm looking forward to continuing my progress as a developer.  It's been a fun and exciting ride so far and I haven't looked back yet!

Capstone:

For my first capstone project I designed Plantae ID, a place to upload images of plants that you wanted identified, marked with a coordinate on google maps to make it easy for others to find these plants in question.

For my second capstone project I made big-canvas, a multiuser drawing tool that continues to expand. All the drawings are persisted into a database, so it can be revisited.
